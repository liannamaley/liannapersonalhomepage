        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        
       Lianna Maley is an artist based out of New Paltz, NY. 
          She is currently in her third year at SUNY studying 
          graphic design with a minor in psychology. Taking on 
          a major switch in her college career from psychobiology 
          to the world of art, college has most certainly been a 
          journey for her. Although the sudden major switch to Graphic
          esign seems sudden, art is far from new for Lianna. Coming 
          from a long line of artists it is no wonder that she made 
          the obvious choice to switch over. Lianna is a muralist and 
          graphic designer and has worked with many local companies to 
          create unique pieces to represent brands as well as to light 
          up a space with art.
